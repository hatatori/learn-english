1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,152
This is the last photo taken by a group of
experienced Russian hikers, the night they

2
00:00:09,152 --> 00:00:11,469
disappeared in February 1959.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,059
Here, in the remote Ural Mountains in Western
Siberia.

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,530
They were on an advanced winter hiking trip,
trekking hundreds of kilometers through frozen

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,530
wilderness.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,280
The photo shows them digging a platform in
deep snow, to pitch their tent along the slope

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
of Kholat Syakhl,

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,049
which translates from the language of the
indigeous people of the region, the Mansi,

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,050
to Dead Mountain.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,635
Hours later, the hikers abandoned the tent
and all of their equipment in the dark.

11
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:45,820
Weeks later, a search party found the tent,
half-destroyed, and covered in snow.

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,260
It had been cut open from the inside.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,540
Frozen bodies, most of them barefoot and wearing
just their sleeping clothes, were found 1,500

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,010
meters away.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,489
Meaning something drove the group from the
tent so fast, there wasn’t even time to

16
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,880
unbutton its entrance

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,900
or put on the heavy winter gear necessary
to survive the conditions outside.

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,580
It would take another 2 months to locate the
rest of the group.

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:16,140
All of them dead, their autopsies revealing
severe injuries that were hard to explain.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,720
Dozens of theories, from alien encounters
to government cover-ups, have developed ever

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
since.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,690
But basically every theory tries to answer
the same question:

23
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,970
What made them leave their tent in the first
place?

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:37,010
The deeper you go into the Dyatlov Pass incident,
named after the group’s leader, 23 year

25
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,450
old Igor Dyatlov, the less things tend to
add up.

26
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,700
So, for the sake of this video, and explaining
what potentially happened that night,

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,850
let’s stick to the most basic facts.

28
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,580
This is a rough diagram showing where the
bodies of the 9 hikers were found in relation

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,170
to the abandoned tent,

30
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,580
stitched together from hand-drawn maps made
during the initial investigation and from

31
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,130
descriptions in the case files.

32
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,909
The bodies were found in three groups.

33
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:09,649
These six died of hypothermia, the rest from
traumatic internal injuries.

34
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,510
These two visuals will help piece together
a picture of what happened to the group after

35
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,780
they left the tent.

36
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,480
The search party found footprints leading
away from the tent that disappeared into the

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,030
snow after about 500m.

38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,489
Continuing in their direction led to the discovery
of the first two bodies.

39
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,550
Under a cedar tree 1,500m downslope from the
tent.

40
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,210
They were wearing almost nothing, and had
built a small fire.

41
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,849
They froze to death.

42
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,020
Three more were found after that in a straight
line from the tree, as if they were trying

43
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,830
to make it back to the tent.

44
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,410
Which in -30 degree temperatures and without
proper clothes, was basically impossible.

45
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,629
They also froze to death.

46
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:53,180
The last four weren’t found until about
2 months later.

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,620
Buried under four meters of snow in a ravine.

48
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,780
And this is where the investigation starts
to get more confusing.

49
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,910
Because, unlike the rest of the group, three
of them had experienced severe internal trauma.

50
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,950
Dubinina and Zolotaryov had multiple broken
ribs, and Thibeaux-Brignolle had a major skull

51
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,160
fracture.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,770
Internal injuries that their autopsy reports
determined were fatal.

53
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,010
The investigation's forensic expert compared
their injuries to the “trauma that results

54
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,480
from the shock wave of a bomb.”

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,370
But there was more.

56
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,340
Zolotaryov and Dubinina were missing their
eyes, and Dubinina was missing her tongue.

57
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,909
She, along with Kolevatov, were wearing clothes
that were contaminated with excessive amounts

58
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:35,599
of radioactive substances.

59
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,459
In spite of many unanswered questions, the
lead Soviet investigator, Lev Ivanov, closed

60
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,310
the case on May 28, 1959.

61
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,380
He concluded that no crime was committed,
citing the hikers’ lack of external injuries,

62
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,180
and that all their valuables were intact.

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:59,290
And that the cause of death was “overwhelming
force, which the hikers were not able to overcome.”

64
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:05,019
Since then, dozens of theories have attempted
to explain what happened that night in 1959:

65
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,700
Murder at the hands of the KGB.

66
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,630
A Yeti attack.

67
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,500
Soviet military experiments gone wrong.

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,480
And, of course, UFOs.

69
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,690
Most of these theories lack substantial evidence.

70
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,380
And some of the more disturbing elements of
the case are aren’t so mysterious after

71
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
all.

72
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,650
The missing soft tissue, Zolotaryov and Dubinina’s
eyes and Dubinina’s tongue, for instance.

73
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,809
Their bodies were found in a creek, and Dubinina
in particular was found face down.

74
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:36,389
The coroner concluded at the time that these
were “post-mortem changes” due to natural

75
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,080
decomposition after months of exposure to
running water.

76
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,909
But two theories in particular, each involving
an “overwhelming force,” offer plausible

77
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,949
solutions to the two most important questions
of the case.

78
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,039
What drove the hikers to abandon the tent
the way they did,

79
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,770
and what could have caused the tremendous
internal injuries that some of them sustained.

80
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,389
One of these theories has been considered,
and debunked, for years.

81
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,770
Avalanche.

82
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,460
Because this area isn’t considered prone
to avalanches, and the internal injuries don’t

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,089
match those typically found in avalanche victims,

84
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:14,360
who mostly die from asphyxiation after being
swept away by snow,

85
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,930
this theory has often been disregarded.

86
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,960
But a scientific paper published in January
2021 demonstrates that the hikers could have

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,819
been hit by a very specific kind of avalanche.

88
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:30,330
GAUME: My name is Johan Gaume, and I'm a professor
at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

89
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,539
and I study snow avalanches.

90
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:37,490
Johan Gaume, and his colleague, geotechnical
engineer Alexander Puzrin,

91
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,639
developed a model that simulates a rare type
of avalanche that could have impacted the

92
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,639
tent.

93
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,680
A delayed slab avalanche.

94
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,918
ARCHIVE: The entire slab moves almost instantaneously.

95
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,434
As it races down the slope it breaks into
large blocks.

96
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:57,268
At its actual speed, it becomes evident why
the wind slab is called the “big killer.”

97
00:05:57,268 --> 00:06:03,497
A slab avalanche occurs when a heavy concentration
of snow forms on a less concentrated weak

98
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,347
layer.

99
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:08,272
GAUME: And when the weak layer fails, this
failure will propagate across the slope and

100
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:10,759
eventually release a slab avalanche.

101
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,839
In the Dyatlov case, the trigger for a slab
avalanche would have been cutting the slope

102
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,650
in order to pitch the tent.

103
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,729
But whatever drove them down the mountain
occurred hours after that.

104
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:26,899
GAUME: We believe that the strong winds brought
some additional snow on top of the tent.

105
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,190
And this led to progressive accumulation and
ultimately the failure of the weak layer,

106
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,120
and the avalanche which impacted the tent
and hikers.

107
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,759
And we showed that this type of impact could
explain the injuries of some of the hikers.

108
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,749
Trapped under the slab, and potentially fearing
a second avalanche,

109
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:48,389
they cut their way out of the tent and made
for the tree line for protection.

110
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:54,369
This theory, constructed by data-driven simulations
and models, shows that a delayed slab avalanche

111
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:56,500
was possible in these conditions,

112
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,580
and could account for the traumatic injuries
within the group.

113
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,650
And doesn’t attempt to explain anything
beyond what drove them from the tent,

114
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,189
like why the group was so underdressed.

115
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:09,800
GAUME: We say that this is possible, that
such a slab avalanche would have injured them

116
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,279
the way they were injured.

117
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,300
Everything after the avalanche is out of the
scope of our paper.

118
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,719
HOLMGREN: It's not difficult to die on Kholat Syakhl,
on the Dead Mountain.

119
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:26,619
Richard Holmgren is a Swedish archaeologist
who led an expedition that retraced the steps

120
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,949
of the Dyatlov group in 2019.

121
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,319
His group has a different explanation for
how these injuries occurred.

122
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,550
HOLMGREN: The goal was to go there exactly
at the same time.

123
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,550
And we wanted to put the tent there exactly
the same night.

124
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,680
We thought that this might help us to understand
their situation.

125
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,199
And after experiencing the severe weather
of the region, his group came to one main

126
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,199
conclusion.

127
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,050
HOLMGREN: In my view, the katabatic scenario
is the only theory that would explain all

128
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,050
the steps.

129
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,379
A katabatic wind is a powerful “falling
wind” that travels down a mountain slope,

130
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:07,789
quickly gaining speed under the force of gravity,
and can create hurricane-like conditions without

131
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:08,789
warning.

132
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:15,759
HOLMGREN: In a katabatic scenario, it goes
very fast from strong winds to uncontrollable

133
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,759
strong winds.

134
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,679
It can change dramatically in seconds, it
doesn’t take any time.

135
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:26,219
If this scenario hit the Dyatlov hikers, the
canvas tent would be at risk of being torn

136
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:28,830
apart,
and would need to be evacuated immediately.

137
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,849
HOLMGREN: It's a matter of seconds, so the
natural procedure to do in this case would

138
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,099
be to cut yourself out very quickly.

139
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,159
And with temperatures around -30 degrees celsius,
their equipment would have been frozen stiff.

140
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,300
HOLMGREN: I know myself, just putting on one
boot in these circumstances takes three to

141
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,029
four minutes. One boot.

142
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:53,140
In the katabatic wind scenario, no one in
the Dyatlov group is seriously injured at

143
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,140
the tent.

144
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,610
And these hypothermia deaths are explained
the same way.

145
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,230
The injuries happen in the ravine where
the bodies were found.

146
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,560
Remember, these bodies were found buried under
around four meters of snow.

147
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,790
They may have dug themselves a snow den for
shelter that collapsed and crushed them.

148
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,180
HOLMGREN: The compressed chests were caused
when the heavy snow collapsed over them.

149
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,709
And it got heavier during the spring, during
thawing.

150
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,639
The injuries could even be post-mortem.

151
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,180
By the time the bodies were found, they had
been decomposing under a crushing snowpack

152
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,550
for months.

153
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,529
On a freezing cold night in February, 1959,
9 experienced hikers dug a platform into a

154
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,420
slope to pitch their tent.

155
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,860
Hours later, something happened suddenly that
drove them into unsurvivable cold without

156
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,209
proper clothes.

157
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:47,209
A slab avalanche or katabatic wind are just
two of many theories.

158
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,269
And they actually have a lot of crossover.

159
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,721
The slab avalanche theory needs katabatic
wind to explain the snow transfer from the

160
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,360
top of the slope.

161
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,490
And the collapsed snow den in the katabatic
theory is explained by a soft snow layer,

162
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,610
the shelter they dug, buckling under a heavy
slab.

163
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,690
Both give compelling reasons for the Dyatlov
group to abandon their tent, and offer a plausible

164
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,779
explanation for the mysterious injuries.

165
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,389
Ultimately though, since there were no survivors,
trying to account for why the hikers did the

166
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,019
things they did ends up raising more questions
than answers.

167
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,550
GAUME: This is one of the most mysterious
parts of the Dyatlov Pass incident

168
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:30,470
The behavior of the hikers after the incident,
after what happened during this night, is

169
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,918
probably the thing that will never be explained.
